Welcome to ESSC2030 - Lecture11 Application of Geoscience 
Tutorial on Stereonegraphic Projection and Stereonet on Python

This tutorial will introduce using Python to analysis and illustrate 3D
geological structures using Stereonet. First of all, there are two methods to
conduct the tutorial. 

    1. Google Colab [Suggested]

    Open a webpage and go to https://colab.research.google.com/

    Select Github on the fourth coloumn in the colored section

    Paste the following link as GitHub URL
        https://github.com/jwjeremy/ESSC2030_lec11

    Select lec11_stereo/Lec11_tut_stereo [Student_version].ipynb
        or lec11_stereo/Lec11_tut_stereo.ipynb if you want answer lol

    The use of google colab is same as jupter notebook. It ultize google server
    to support the ipython console at backend, which allow us to run on webpage.

    On the left coloumn, you can select table of content to navigate throughout
    the tutorial. 

    Please be noted that it is unable to save the record automatically. You can
    download the .ipynb and replace the one in tutorial package.
    

    2. Run locally

    Since the following tutorial requires python2 and relevant packages, please
    create a new conda environment using the lec11_stereo.yml

    conda env create -f lec11_stereo.yml

    To activate the installed environment, please type
        activate conda activate lec11_stereo

    and start the tutoral by creating jupyter notebook session
        jupyter notebook


Other intstructions are written in the .ipynb. Have fun with the tutorial~
