    IMPORTANT NOTE: Binder is an amazing resource, but since it is an open resource, it needs to be mindful of how many concurrent users there are. This means that if you are inactive for more than 10 minutes, it will shut off your connection and you will need to restart the live session from the static view webpage. To help you identify when this disconnection occurs, it will tell you with a browser pop up message and a red Not Connected message will appear on the right side of the header. So it would be wise to keep the static view of the notebook open while you are working on the interactive page in case you need to re-open the interactive page.

Run online using google colab
